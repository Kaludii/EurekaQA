## EurekaQA - Question & Answering Model

EurekaQA is a Question & Answering Model that has been trained by [Kaludi](https://huggingface.co/Kaludi) to analyze text data and automatically answer questions based on the information contained within. The model uses advanced machine learning algorithms to perform extractive question-answering, meaning it selects the relevant information from a given text document to present as the answer to the question.

The model is trained on the [EurekaQA dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kaludi/data-eurekaQA) and the model can be found on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Kaludi/eurekaQA-model).

EurekaQA can be used in a variety of applications, including customer service, virtual assistants, and information retrieval systems.

## How to use EurekaQA

You can use EurekaQA by importing the `pipeline` method from the `transformers` library and setting the task to "question-answering" and the model to "Kaludi/eurekaQA-model". You can then pass in a context and a question as a list to the `pipeline` method to receive the answer.

`from transformers import pipeline

context = "The Greater Mexico City has a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$411 billion in 2011, making Mexico City urban agglomeration one of the economically largest metropolitan areas in the world. The city was responsible for generating 15.8% of Mexico's Gross Domestic Product and the metropolitan area accounted for about 22% of total national GDP. As a stand-alone country, in 2013, Mexico City would be the fifth-largest economy in Latin Americaâ€”five times as large as Costa Rica's and about the same size as Peru's."
question = "What percent of the Mexican GDP is the metropolitan area of Mexico City responsible for?"

question_answer = pipeline("question-answering", model = "Kaludi/eurekaQA-model")

answer = question_answer([context, question], top_k=1)
print(answer)`
